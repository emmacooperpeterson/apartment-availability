## Simple scraping functions to monitor apartment availability

Apartment websites are terrible :-)

I'll be adding functions here to check on the availability of the floorplans
that I'm interested in at each building.

Checking current availabilities:
1. Run `run_checks.py` and open the resulting `json`

Adding a building:
1. Add a function to `check_availabilities.py`
2. Update `CONFIG` in `config.py`
3. Run `run_checks.py` and open the resulting `json`
